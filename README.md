Data synthesis for species sensitivity modeling

This project contains scripts (Python and R) that extract specific datasets from the [NEON data repository](http://data.neonscience.org/home) (using the [NEON API](http://data.neonscience.org/data-api)) and merge these datasets into formats that facilitate use in the [GJAM](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/gjam/index.html) modeling package.
