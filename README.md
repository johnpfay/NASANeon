Data synthesis for species sensitivity modeling

This project contains scripts (Python and R) that extract specific geographic datasets from the [NEON data repository](http://data.neonscience.org/home) (using the [NEON API](http://data.neonscience.org/data-api)) and extract values at these locations from select remote sensing datsets to product tables in a format used in the [GJAM](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/gjam/index.html) modeling package. 

Eventually, this repository will include scripts that can execute GJAM to reveal the sensitivies of different species to climate change.
